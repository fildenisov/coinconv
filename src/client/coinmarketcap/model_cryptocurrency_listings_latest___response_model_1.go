 * CoinMarketCap Cryptocurrency API Documentation
 *
 * # Introduction The CoinMarketCap API is a suite of high-performance RESTful JSON endpoints that are specifically designed to meet the mission-critical demands of application developers, data scientists, and enterprise business platforms.  This API reference includes all technical documentation developers need to integrate third-party applications and platforms. Additional answers to common questions can be found in the [CoinMarketCap API FAQ](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/faq).  # Quick Start Guide  For developers eager to hit the ground running with the CoinMarketCap API here are a few quick steps to make your first call with the API.  1. **Sign up for a free Developer Portal account.** You can sign up at [pro.coinmarketcap.com](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com) - This is our live production environment with the latest market data. Select the free `Basic` plan if it meets your needs or upgrade to a paid tier. 2. **Copy your API Key.** Once you sign up you'll land on your Developer Portal account dashboard. Copy your API from the `API Key` box in the top left panel. 3. **Make a test call using your key.** You may use the code examples provided below to make a test call with your programming language of choice. This example [fetches all active cryptocurrencies by market cap and return market values in USD](https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest?start=1&limit=5000&convert=USD).     *Be sure to replace the API Key in sample code with your own and use API domain `pro-api.coinmarketcap.com` or use the test API Key `b54bcf4d-1bca-4e8e-9a24-22ff2c3d462c` for `sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com` testing with our sandbox environment. Please note that our sandbox api has mock data and should not be used in your application.* 4. **Postman Collection** To help with development, we provide a fully featured postman collection that you can import and use immediately! [Read more here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/register-for-coinmarketcap-api). 5. **Implement your application.** Now that you've confirmed your API Key is working, get familiar with the API by reading the rest of this API Reference and commence building your application!  ***Note:** Making HTTP requests on the client side with Javascript is currently prohibited through CORS configuration. This is to protect your API Key which should not be visible to users of your application so your API Key is not stolen. Secure your API Key by routing calls through your own backend service.*  <details open=\"open\"> <summary>**View Quick Start Code Examples**</summary> <details open=\"open\"> <summary>cURL command line</summary> ```bash  curl -H \"X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY: b54bcf4d-1bca-4e8e-9a24-22ff2c3d462c\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" -d \"start=1&limit=5000&convert=USD\" -G https://sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest  ```     </details><details> <summary>Node.js</summary> ```javascript   /_* Example in Node.js *_/ const axios = require('axios');

If you don't have an API Key yet visit the [API Developer Portal](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) to register for one.  ### Using Your API Key You may use any *server side* programming language that can make HTTP requests to target the CoinMarketCap API. All requests should target domain `https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com`.  You can supply your API Key in REST API calls in one of two ways:  1. Preferred method: Via a custom header named `X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY` 2. Convenience method: Via a query string parameter named `CMC_PRO_API_KEY`  ***Security Warning:** It's important to secure your API Key against public access. The custom header option is strongly recommended over the querystring option for passing your API Key in a production environment.*  ### API Key Usage Credits  Most API plans include a daily and monthly limit or \"hard cap\" to the number of data calls that can be made. This usage is tracked as API \"call credits\" which are incremented 1:1 against successful (HTTP Status 200) data calls made with your key with these exceptions: - Account management endpoints, usage stats endpoints, and error responses are not included in this limit.   - **Paginated endpoints:** List-based endpoints track an additional call credit for every 100 data points returned (rounded up) beyond our 100 data point defaults. Our lightweight `/map` endpoints are not included in this limit and always count as 1 credit. See individual endpoint documentation for more details.    - **Bundled API calls:** Many endpoints support [resource and currency conversion bundling](#section/Standards-and-Conventions). Bundled resources are also tracked as 1 call credit for every 100 resources returned (rounded up). Optional currency conversion bundling using the `convert` parameter also increment an additional API call credit for every conversion requested beyond the first.  You can log in to the [Developer Portal](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) to view live stats on your API Key usage and limits including the number of credits used for each call. You can also find call credit usage in the JSON response for each API call. See the [`status` object](#section/Standards-and-Conventions) for details. You may also use the [/key/info](#operation/getV1KeyInfo) endpoint to quickly review your usage and when daily/monthly credits reset directly from the API.    ***Note:** \"day\" and \"month\" credit usage periods are defined relative to your API subscription. For example, if your monthly subscription started on the 5th at 5:30am, this billing anchor is also when your monthly credits refresh each month. The free Basic tier resets each day at UTC midnight and each calendar month at UTC midnight.*     # Endpoint Overview  ### The CoinMarketCap API is divided into 8 top-level categories Endpoint Category  | Description -------------------|--------------- [/cryptocurrency/_*](#tag/cryptocurrency) | Endpoints that return data around cryptocurrencies such as ordered cryptocurrency lists or price and volume data. [/exchange/_*](#tag/exchange) | Endpoints that return data around cryptocurrency exchanges such as ordered exchange lists and market pair data. [/global-metrics/_*](#tag/global-metrics) | Endpoints that return aggregate market data such as global market cap and BTC dominance. [/tools/_*](#tag/tools)  | Useful utilities such as cryptocurrency and fiat price conversions. [/blockchain/_*](#tag/blockchain)  | Endpoints that return block explorer related data for blockchains. [/fiat/_*](#tag/fiat) | Endpoints that return data around fiats currencies including mapping to CMC IDs. [/partners/_*](#tag/partners)  | Endpoints for convenient access to 3rd party crypto data. [/key/_*](#tag/key)  | API key administration endpoints to review and manage your usage. [/content/_*](#tag/content)  | Endpoints that return cryptocurrency-related news, headlines, articles, posts, and comments.  ### Endpoint paths follow a pattern matching the type of data provided  Endpoint Path  | Endpoint Type | Description ----------------------|-------------|--------- *_/latest | Latest Market Data | Latest market ticker quotes and averages for cryptocurrencies and exchanges. *_/historical | Historical Market Data | Intervals of historic market data like OHLCV data or data for use in charting libraries. *_/info | Metadata | Cryptocurrency and exchange metadata like block explorer URLs and logos. *_/map | ID Maps | Utility endpoints to get a map of resources to CoinMarketCap IDs.  ###  Cryptocurrency and exchange endpoints provide 2 different ways of accessing data depending on purpose  - **Listing endpoints:** Flexible paginated `*_/listings/_*` endpoints allow you to sort and filter lists of data like cryptocurrencies by market cap or exchanges by volume. - **Item endpoints:** Convenient ID-based resource endpoints like `*_/quotes/_*` and `*_/market-pairs/_*` allow you to bundle several IDs; for example, this allows you to get latest market quotes for a specific set of cryptocurrencies in one call.  # Standards and Conventions  Each HTTP request must contain the header `Accept: application/json`. You should also send an `Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip` header to receive data fast and efficiently.  ### Endpoint Response Payload Format All endpoints return data in JSON format with the results of your query under `data` if the call is successful.  A `Status` object is always included for both successful calls and failures when possible. The `Status` object always includes the current time on the server when the call was executed as `timestamp`, the number of API call credits this call utilized as `credit_count`, and the number of milliseconds it took to process the request as `elapsed`. Any details about errors encountered can be found under the `error_code` and `error_message`. See [Errors and Rate Limits](#section/Errors-and-Rate-Limits) for details on errors.  ``` {   \"data\" : {     ...   },   \"status\": {     \"timestamp\": \"2018-06-06T07:52:27.273Z\",     \"error_code\": 400,     \"error_message\": \"Invalid value for \\\"id\\\"\",     \"elapsed\": 0,     \"credit_count\": 0   } } ```  ### Cryptocurrency, Exchange, and Fiat currency identifiers - Cryptocurrencies may be identified in endpoints using either the cryptocurrency's unique CoinMarketCap ID as `id` (eg. `id=1` for Bitcoin) or the cryptocurrency's symbol (eg. `symbol=BTC` for Bitcoin). For a current list of supported cryptocurrencies use our [`/cryptocurrency/map` call](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyMap). - Exchanges may be identified in endpoints using either the exchange's unique CoinMarketCap ID as `id` (eg. `id=270` for Binance) or the exchange's web slug (eg. `slug=binance` for Binance). For a current list of supported exchanges use our [`/exchange/map` call](#operation/getV1ExchangeMap). - All fiat currency options use the standard [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) currency code (eg. `USD` for the US Dollar). For a current list of supported fiat currencies use our [`/fiat/map`](#operation/getV1FiatMap) endpoint. Unless otherwise stated, endpoints with fiat currency options like our `convert` parameter support these 93 major currency codes:  Currency | Currency Code | CoinMarketCap ID ---------|---------------|------------- United States Dollar ($) | USD | 2781 Albanian Lek (L) | ALL | 3526 Algerian Dinar (د.ج) | DZD | 3537 Argentine Peso ($) | ARS | 2821 Armenian Dram (֏) | AMD | 3527 Australian Dollar ($) | AUD | 2782 Azerbaijani Manat (₼) | AZN | 3528 Bahraini Dinar (.د.ب) | BHD | 3531 Bangladeshi Taka (৳) | BDT | 3530 Belarusian Ruble (Br) | BYN | 3533 Bermudan Dollar ($) | BMD | 3532 Bolivian Boliviano (Bs.) | BOB | 2832 Bosnia-Herzegovina Convertible Mark (KM) | BAM | 3529 Brazilian Real (R$) | BRL | 2783 Bulgarian Lev (лв) | BGN | 2814 Cambodian Riel (៛) | KHR | 3549 Canadian Dollar ($) | CAD | 2784 Chilean Peso ($) | CLP | 2786 Chinese Yuan (¥) | CNY | 2787 Colombian Peso ($) | COP | 2820 Costa Rican Colón (₡) | CRC | 3534 Croatian Kuna (kn) | HRK | 2815 Cuban Peso ($) | CUP | 3535 Czech Koruna (Kč) | CZK | 2788 Danish Krone (kr) | DKK | 2789 Dominican Peso ($) | DOP | 3536 Egyptian Pound (£) | EGP | 3538 Euro (€) | EUR | 2790 Georgian Lari (₾) | GEL | 3539 Ghanaian Cedi (₵) | GHS | 3540 Guatemalan Quetzal (Q) | GTQ | 3541 Honduran Lempira (L) | HNL | 3542 Hong Kong Dollar ($) | HKD | 2792 Hungarian Forint (Ft) | HUF | 2793 Icelandic Króna (kr) | ISK | 2818 Indian Rupee (₹) | INR | 2796 Indonesian Rupiah (Rp) | IDR | 2794 Iranian Rial (﷼) | IRR | 3544 Iraqi Dinar (ع.د) | IQD | 3543 Israeli New Shekel (₪) | ILS | 2795 Jamaican Dollar ($) | JMD | 3545 Japanese Yen (¥) | JPY | 2797 Jordanian Dinar (د.ا) | JOD | 3546 Kazakhstani Tenge (₸) | KZT | 3551 Kenyan Shilling (Sh) | KES | 3547 Kuwaiti Dinar (د.ك) | KWD | 3550 Kyrgystani Som (с) | KGS | 3548 Lebanese Pound (ل.ل) | LBP | 3552 Macedonian Denar (ден) | MKD | 3556 Malaysian Ringgit (RM) | MYR | 2800 Mauritian Rupee (₨) | MUR | 2816 Mexican Peso ($) | MXN | 2799 Moldovan Leu (L) | MDL | 3555 Mongolian Tugrik (₮) | MNT | 3558 Moroccan Dirham (د.م.) | MAD | 3554 Myanma Kyat (Ks) | MMK | 3557 Namibian Dollar ($) | NAD | 3559 Nepalese Rupee (₨) | NPR | 3561 New Taiwan Dollar (NT$) | TWD | 2811 New Zealand Dollar ($) | NZD | 2802 Nicaraguan Córdoba (C$) | NIO | 3560 Nigerian Naira (₦) | NGN | 2819 Norwegian Krone (kr) | NOK | 2801 Omani Rial (ر.ع.) | OMR | 3562 Pakistani Rupee (₨) | PKR | 2804 Panamanian Balboa (B/.) | PAB | 3563 Peruvian Sol (S/.) | PEN | 2822 Philippine Peso (₱) | PHP | 2803 Polish Złoty (zł) | PLN | 2805 Pound Sterling (£) | GBP | 2791 Qatari Rial (ر.ق) | QAR | 3564 Romanian Leu (lei) | RON | 2817 Russian Ruble (₽) | RUB | 2806 Saudi Riyal (ر.س) | SAR | 3566 Serbian Dinar (дин.) | RSD | 3565 Singapore Dollar (S$) | SGD | 2808 South African Rand (R) | ZAR | 2812 South Korean Won (₩) | KRW | 2798 South Sudanese Pound (£) | SSP | 3567 Sovereign Bolivar (Bs.) | VES | 3573 Sri Lankan Rupee (Rs) | LKR | 3553 Swedish Krona (  kr) | SEK | 2807 Swiss Franc (Fr) | CHF | 2785 Thai Baht (฿) | THB | 2809 Trinidad and Tobago Dollar ($) | TTD | 3569 Tunisian Dinar (د.ت) | TND | 3568 Turkish Lira (₺) | TRY | 2810 Ugandan Shilling (Sh) | UGX | 3570 Ukrainian Hryvnia (₴) | UAH | 2824 United Arab Emirates Dirham (د.إ) | AED | 2813 Uruguayan Peso ($) | UYU | 3571 Uzbekistan Som (so'm) | UZS | 3572 Vietnamese Dong (₫) | VND | 2823    Along with these four precious metals:    Precious Metal | Currency Code | CoinMarketCap ID ---------|---------------|------------- Gold Troy Ounce | XAU | 3575 Silver Troy Ounce | XAG | 3574 Platinum Ounce | XPT | 3577 Palladium Ounce | XPD | 3576   ***Warning:** **Using CoinMarketCap IDs is always recommended as not all cryptocurrency symbols are unique. They can also change with a cryptocurrency rebrand.** If a symbol is used the API will always default to the cryptocurrency with the highest market cap if there are multiple matches. Our `convert` parameter also defaults to fiat if a cryptocurrency symbol also matches a supported fiat currency. You may use the convenient `/map` endpoints to quickly find the corresponding CoinMarketCap ID for a cryptocurrency or exchange.*  ### Bundling API Calls - Many endpoints support ID and crypto/fiat currency conversion bundling. This means you can pass multiple comma-separated values to an endpoint to query or convert several items at once. Check the `id`, `symbol`, `slug`, and `convert` query parameter descriptions in the endpoint documentation to see if this is supported for an endpoint. - Endpoints that support bundling return data as an object map instead of an array. Each key-value pair will use the identifier you passed in as the key.  For example, if you passed `symbol=BTC,ETH` to `/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest` you would receive:  ``` \"data\" : {     \"BTC\" : {       ...     },     \"ETH\" : {       ...     } } ```  Or if you passed `id=1,1027` you would receive:  ``` \"data\" : {     \"1\" : {       ...     },     \"1027\" : {       ...     } } ```  Price conversions that are returned inside endpoint responses behave in the same fashion. These are enclosed in a `quote` object.  ### Date and Time Formats - All endpoints that require date/time parameters allow timestamps to be passed in either [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format (eg. `2018-06-06T01:46:40Z`) or in Unix time (eg. `1528249600`). Timestamps that are passed in ISO 8601 format support basic and extended notations; if a timezone is not included, UTC will be the default. - All timestamps returned in JSON payloads are returned in UTC time using human-readable ISO 8601 format which follows this pattern: `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmZ`. The final `.mmm` designates milliseconds. Per the ISO 8601 spec the final `Z` is a constant that represents UTC time. - Data is collected, recorded, and reported in UTC time unless otherwise specified.  ### Versioning The CoinMarketCap API is versioned to guarantee new features and updates are non-breaking. The latest version of this API is `/v1/`.  # Errors and Rate Limits  ### API Request Throttling Use of the CoinMarketCap API is subject to API call rate limiting or \"request throttling\". This is the number of HTTP calls that can be made simultaneously or within the same minute with your API Key before receiving an HTTP 429 \"Too Many Requests\" throttling error. This limit scales with the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/features\" target=\"_blank\">usage tier</a> and resets every 60 seconds. Please review our <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"#section/Best-Practices\" target=\"_blank\">Best Practices</a> for implementation strategies that work well with rate limiting.  ### HTTP Status Codes The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call.  - `400 (Bad Request)` The server could not process the request, likely due to an invalid argument. - `401 (Unauthorized)` Your request lacks valid authentication credentials, likely an issue with your API Key. - `402 (Payment Required)` Your API request was rejected due to it being a paid subscription plan with an overdue balance. Pay the balance in the [Developer Portal billing tab](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/account/plan) and it will be enabled. - `403 (Forbidden)` Your request was rejected due to a permission issue, likely a restriction on the API Key's associated service plan. Here is a [convenient map](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/features) of service plans to endpoints. - `429 (Too Many Requests)` The API Key's rate limit was exceeded; consider slowing down your API Request frequency if this is an HTTP request throttling error. Consider upgrading your service plan if you have reached your monthly API call credit limit for the day/month. - `500 (Internal Server Error)` An unexpected server issue was encountered.  ### Error Response Codes A `Status` object is always included in the JSON response payload for both successful calls and failures when possible. During error scenarios you may reference the `error_code` and `error_message` properties of the Status object. One of the API error codes below will be returned if applicable otherwise the HTTP status code for the general error type is returned.     HTTP Status | Error Code | Error Message ------------|----------------|------------- 401 | 1001 [API_KEY_INVALID] | This API Key is invalid. 401 | 1002 [API_KEY_MISSING] | API key missing. 402 | 1003 [API_KEY_PLAN_REQUIRES_PAYEMENT] | Your API Key must be activated. Please go to pro.coinmarketcap.com/account/plan. 402 | 1004 [API_KEY_PLAN_PAYMENT_EXPIRED] | Your API Key's subscription plan has expired. 403 | 1005 [API_KEY_REQUIRED] | An API Key is required for this call. 403 | 1006 [API_KEY_PLAN_NOT_AUTHORIZED] | Your API Key subscription plan doesn't support this endpoint. 403 | 1007 [API_KEY_DISABLED] | This API Key has been disabled. Please contact support. 429 | 1008 [API_KEY_PLAN_MINUTE_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED] | You've exceeded your API Key's HTTP request rate limit. Rate limits reset every minute. 429 | 1009 [API_KEY_PLAN_DAILY_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED] | You've exceeded your API Key's daily rate limit. 429 | 1010 [API_KEY_PLAN_MONTHLY_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED] | You've exceeded your API Key's monthly rate limit. 429 | 1011 [IP_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED] | You've hit an IP rate limit.    # Best Practices  This section contains a few recommendations on how to efficiently utilize the CoinMarketCap API for your enterprise application, particularly if you already have a large base of users for your application.  ### Use CoinMarketCap ID Instead of Cryptocurrency Symbol  Utilizing common cryptocurrency symbols to reference cryptocurrencies on the API is easy and convenient but brittle. You should know that many cryptocurrencies have the same symbol, for example, there are currently three cryptocurrencies that commonly refer to themselves by the symbol HOT. Cryptocurrency symbols also often change with cryptocurrency rebrands. When fetching cryptocurrency by a symbol that matches several active cryptocurrencies we return the one with the highest market cap at the time of the query. To ensure you always target the cryptocurrency you expect, use our permanent CoinMarketCap IDs. These IDs are used reliably by numerous mission critical platforms and *never change*.      We make fetching a map of all active cryptocurrencies' CoinMarketCap IDs very easy. Just call our [`/cryptocurrency/map`](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyMap) endpoint to receive a list of all active currencies mapped to the unique `id` property. This map also includes other typical identifiying properties like `name`, `symbol` and platform `token_address` that can be cross referenced. In cryptocurrency calls you would then send, for example `id=1027`, instead of `symbol=ETH`. **It's strongly recommended that any production code utilize these IDs for cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and markets to future-proof your code.**   ### Use the Right Endpoints for the Job  You may have noticed that `/cryptocurrency/listings/latest` and `/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest` return the same crypto data but in different formats. This is because the former is for requesting paginated and ordered lists of *all* cryptocurrencies while the latter is for selectively requesting only the specific cryptocurrencies you require. Many endpoints follow this pattern, allow the design of these endpoints to work for you!  ### Implement a Caching Strategy If Needed  There are standard legal data safeguards built into the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/user-agreement-commercial\" target=\"_blank\">Commercial User Terms</a> that application developers should keep in mind. These Terms help prevent unauthorized scraping and redistributing of CMC data but are intentionally worded to allow legitimate local caching of market data to support the operation of your application. If your application has a significant user base and you are concerned with staying within the call credit and API throttling limits of your subscription plan consider implementing a data caching strategy.  For example instead of making a `/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest` call every time one of your application's users needs to fetch market rates for specific cryptocurrencies, you could pre-fetch and cache the latest market data for every cryptocurrency in your application's local database every 60 seconds. This would only require 1 API call, `/cryptocurrency/listings/latest?limit=5000`, every 60 seconds. Then, anytime one of your application's users need to load a custom list of cryptocurrencies you could simply pull this latest market data from your local cache without the overhead of additional calls. This kind of optimization is practical for customers with large, demanding user bases.  ###  Code Defensively to Ensure a Robust REST API Integration  Whenever implementing any high availability REST API service for mission critical operations it's recommended to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming\" target=\"_blank\">code defensively</a>. Since the API is versioned, any breaking request or response format change would only be introduced through new versions of each endpoint, *however existing endpoints may still introduce new convenience properties over time*.   We suggest these best practices:  - You should parse the API response JSON as JSON and not through a regular expression or other means to avoid brittle parsing logic. - Your parsing code should explicitly parse only the response properties you require to guarantee new fields that may be returned in the future are ignored.  - You should add robust field validation to your response parsing logic. You can wrap complex field parsing, like dates, in try/catch statements to minimize the impact of unexpected parsing issues (like the unlikely return of a null value).  - Implement a \"Retry with exponential backoff\" coding pattern for your REST API call logic. This means if your HTTP request happens to get rate limited (HTTP 429) or encounters an unexpected server-side condition (HTTP 5xx) your code would automatically recover and try again using an intelligent recovery scheme. You may use one of the many libraries available; for example, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tim-kos/node-retry\">this one</a> for Node or <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/litl/backoff\">this one</a> for Python.  ### Reach Out and Upgrade Your Plan  If you're uncertain how to best implement the CoinMarketCap API in your application or your needs outgrow our current self-serve subscription tiers you can reach out to api@coinmarketcap.com. We'll review your needs and budget and may be able to tailor a custom enterprise plan that is right for you.    # Version History      The CoinMarketCap API utilizes <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://semver.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Semantic Versioning</a> in the format `major.minor.patch`. The current `major` version is incorporated into the API request path as `/v1/`. Non-breaking `minor` and `patch` updates to the API are released regularly. These may include new endpoints, data points, and API plan features which are always introduced in a non-breaking manner. *This means you can expect new properties to become available in our existing /v1/ endpoints however any breaking change will be introduced under a new major version of the API with legacy versions supported indefinitely unless otherwise stated*.      You can [subscribe to our API Newsletter](/#newsletter-signup) to get monthly email updates on CoinMarketCap API enhancements.  ### v1.0.0 on September 19, 2022  - [/v1/content/posts/top](#operation/getV1ContentPostsTop) now available to get cryptocurrency-related top posts. - [/v1/content/posts/latest](#operation/getV1ContentPostsLatest) now available to get cryptocurrency-related latest posts. - [/v1/content/posts/comments](#operation/getV1ContentPostsComments) now available to get comments of the post.  ### v1.0.0 on Augest 18, 2022  - [/v1/content/latest](#operation/getV1ContentLatest) now available to get news/headlines and Alexandria articles.  ### v1.0.0 on Augest 4, 2022  - [/v1/tools/postman](#operation/getV1ToolsPostman) now API postman collection is available.  ### v2.0.4 on October 11, 2021  - [/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyListingsLatest) now includes `volume_change_24h`. - [/v2/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest](#operation/getV2CryptocurrencyQuotesLatest) now includes `volume_change_24h`.  ### v2.0.3 on October 6, 2021  - [/v1/cryptocurrency/trending/latest](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyTrendingLatest) now supports `time_period` as an optional parameter.  ### v2.0.2 on September 13, 2021  - [/exchange/map](#operation/getV1ExchangeMap) now available to Free tier users. - [/exchange/info](#operation/getV1ExchangeInfo) now available to Free tier users.  ### v2.0.1 on September 8, 2021  - [/exchange/market-pairs/latest](#operation/getV1ExchangeMarketpairsLatest) now includes `volume_24h`, `depth_negative_two`, `depth_positive_two` and `volume_percentage`. - [/exchange/listings/latest](#operation/getV1ExchangeListingsLatest) now includes `open_interest`. ### v2.0.0 on August 17, 2021  - By popular request we have added a number of new useful endpoints ! - [/v1/cryptocurrency/categories](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyCategories) can be used to access a list of categories and their associated coins.

We've also made this plan 12% cheaper at $29/mo with a yearly subscription or $35/mo month-to-month. - Our Startup tier can now access a month of cryptocurrency OHLCV data via [/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyOhlcvHistorical) along with [/tools/price-conversion](#operation/getV1ToolsPriceconversion). - Our Standard tier has been upgraded from 1 month to now 3 months of historical market data access across all historical endpoints.  - Our Enterprise, Professional, and Standard tiers now get access to a new #18th endpoint [/cryptocurrency/listings/historical](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyListingsHistorical)! Utilize this endpoint to fetch daily historical crypto rankings from the past. We've made historical ranking snapshots available all the way back to 2013!   - All existing accounts and subscribers may take advantage of these updates. If you haven't signed up yet you can check out our updated plans on our <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/api/features/\" target=\"_blank\">feature comparison page</a>.    ### v1.12.0 on Apr 28, 2019    - Our API docs now supply API request examples in 7 languages for every endpoint: cURL, Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, C#, and Go. - Many customer sites format cryptocurrency data page URLs by SEO friendly names like we do here: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/\" target=\"_blank\">coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin</a>. We've made it much easier for these kinds of pages to dynamically reference data from our API. You may now request cryptocurrencies from our [/cryptocurrency/info](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyInfo) and [/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyQuotesLatest) endpoints by `slug` as an alternative to `symbol` or `id`. As always, you can retrieve a quick list of every cryptocurrency we support and it's `id`, `symbol`, and `slug` via our [/cryptocurrency/map](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyMap) endpoint.   - We've increased `convert` limits on historical endpoints once more. You can now request historical market data in up to 3 conversion options at a time like we do internally to display line charts <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/0x/#charts\" target=\"_blank\">like this</a>. You can now fetch market data converted into your primary cryptocurrency, fiat currency, and a parent platform cryptocurrency (Ethereum in this case) all in one call!     ### v1.11.0 on Mar 25, 2019  - We now supply a brief text summary for each cryptocurrency in the `description` field of [/cryptocurrency/info](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyInfo). The majority of top cryptocurrencies include this field with more coming in the future.   - We've made `convert` limits on some endpoints and plans more flexible. Historical endpoints are now allowed 2 price conversion options instead of 1. Professional plan convert limit has doubled from 40 to 80. Enterprise has tripled from 40 to 120.   - CoinMarketCap Market ID: We now return `market_id` in /market-pairs/latest endpoints. Like our cryptocurrency and exchange IDs, this ID can reliably be used to uniquely identify each market *permanently* as this ID never changes.   - Market symbol overrides: We now supply an `exchange_symbol` in addition to `currency_symbol` for each market pair returned in our /market-pairs/latest endpoints. This allows you to reference the currency symbol provided by the exchange in case it differs from the CoinMarketCap identified symbol that the majority of markets use.      ### v1.10.1 on Jan 30, 2019  - Our API health status dashboard is now public at http://status.coinmarketcap.com.   - We now conveniently return `market_cap` in our [/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyOhlcvHistorical) endpoint so you don't have to make a separately query when fetching historic OHLCV data.  - We've improved the accuracy of percent_change_1h / 24h / 7d calculations when using the `convert` option with our latest cryptocurrency endpoints.  - [/cryptocurrency/market-pairs/latest](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyMarketpairsLatest) now updates more frequently, every 1 minute.   - Contract Address and parent platform metadata changes are reflected on the API much more quickly.      ### v1.9.0 on Jan 8, 2019    - Did you know there are currently 684 active USD market pairs tracked by CoinMarketCap?

Look for the new `platform` property on our cryptocurrency endpoints like [/cryptocurrency/listings/latest](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyListingsLatest) and [/cryptocurrency/map](#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyMap).  - We've also added a **CMC equivalent pages** section to our endpoint docs so you can easily determine which endpoints to use to reproduce functionality on the main coinmarketcap.com website.   - Welcome Public API users! With the migration of our legacy Public API into the Professional API we now have 1 unified API at CMC.

Standard plan has been upgraded from 30 to 60 calls per minute. Professional from 60 to 90. Enterprise from 90 to 120.   - We now include some customer and data partner logos and testimonials on the CoinMarketCap API site.

Additional tags will be introduced in the future. - We've increased the \"convert\" parameter limit from 32 to 40 for plans that support max conversion limits.     ### v1.2.0 on Oct 30, 2018  - Our exchange [listing](#operation/getV1ExchangeListingsLatest) and [quotes](#operation/getV1ExchangeQuotesLatest) endpoints now update much more frequently!
